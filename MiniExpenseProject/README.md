# Programming in Python

This is a mini project I created when I returned back to studies to refresh knowledge in Python.  Here, the problem statement was to create a small finance tracker application that would keep track of the finance expenses while the program is running. The app must set be able to set a budget, add up expenses, and any transaction beyond the current budget will not be accepted.

The objective is to explore my technical skills in Python to come up with a solution.

## Tools:
- Anaconda (Python Notebook)

Solution:

- Defined main() function, within the function I declared variables (menu, budget, and expense)
- Used while loop to control the program flow
- Created User Define Functions for the following:
    a. Add Expense
    b. Subtract Expense
    c. Add Budget
    d. Substract Budget
    e. Validation

Disclamer:  The UDF may not always be required since this program is really small but to make the coding more efficient and practice coding standards, I decided to add them anyways.  There are various ways to code this but I decided to add this one in particular for my own personal thing.
